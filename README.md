# thediceproject

This project was built as a part of the 'Complete Web Dev Bootcamp by Angela Yu'.The dice project is a multiplayer dice game, human vs the system where the rules of the game are straightforward. The person who rolls a die whose number is greater than the other wins the round and proceeds to the next. This was a beginner-level project that I built while learning JavaScript and gave me a thorough idea of event listeners, DOM,Math.random() function of JavaScript.
